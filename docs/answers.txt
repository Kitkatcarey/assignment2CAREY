2/23/24 went through the GitLab Tutorials.
9/6/2023 I set up my GitHub Account.

2. There have been 5 commits done to the repository.
PS C:\Users\kathr\assignment2CAREY> git log

3. The last time the README.md file was edited was by me on Friday February 23 at 5:11pm.
PS C:\Users\kathr\assignment2CAREY> git log README.md

4. Branches allow you to make changes to the repository without actually changing the original one.
It also allows for multiple people to work on the project without interfering with each others code.

5. Git log shows the history of commits in the repository, white git status gives information about
the current state of the working directory and staging area.

6. I would use git log Vehicle.h, to see the commits for that file.
PS C:\Users\kathr\assignment2CAREY> git log Vehicle.h

7. I would use git log --grep=file.
PS C:\Users\kathr\assignment2CAREY> git log --grep=file

8. Inheritance is when a child class is created from a parent class, inheriting properties and 
behaviors fromt the parent. Polymorphism allows objects to take on different forms or behaviors based on context.
Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods into a single class.

9. In the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow, only the dictator can push to the central repository. In the Integration
manager workflow,developers can push their own repositories and conflicts are resolved centrally.

9. The Dictator and Lieutenants workflow simplifies descision making and improves scalability by delegating tasks.
